# Site Media Storage

Use this folder to store site-specific assets such as hero images, floor plans, and thumbnails. Organize uploads by company or project, for example:

```
/AdityaBirla/overview.jpg
/TCS/headquarters.png
/Reliance/marketing-banner.webp
```

Alongside each image, include a short description file (for example `overview.txt`) so the frontend can surface contextual copy for that site.
